1) Review of Anomaly Detection Algorithms for Data Streams
This is a good research that helped in medical fields, IoT, network security, and smart cities. This research used Stats and ML. This research has 69 citations.
Achievements
Healthcare monitoring
Traffic flow detection
Abnormal patterns detection online
Drawbacks
This model also has some issues, the main issue that i found out was it couldn’t adapt with increasing threats because the model got outdated.
Idea
I have an idea of building a concept of adapting itself with the level of threats like auto being up to date.

2) A comparative analysis of various machine learning methods for anomaly detection in cyber attacks on IoT networks
This research paper has 91 citations focusing on protection of smart home devices, sensors, cameras from cyber threat.
Models used
Neurel networks
SVM
Decison tree
K nearest neighbours
Logistic regression
Achievements
F1 score of 99%, neural network best model
This helped in handling large amount of IOT data
Neural Network helped in reducing false alarms
Challenges
The camera had limited computation power, so neural networks struggled to run on these
This research also has the same issue of model not being trained for evolving attacks
Idea
Trying to make a model that does not require high computations, and can work on small devices and sensors
Datasets used
ToN-IoT Dataset
BoT-IoT Dataset

3) Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning Techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks
This research paper has 107 citations, mainly focusing on small wireless sensors, which are used in agriculture, hospitals, office, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.
Models used
Feature Selection (Information Gain Ratio)
Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier
Achievements
This model was 96% accurate in detecting all attacks
Unlike many traditional models that need all the data at once, this one can learn and update continuously as data streams in.
This model had reduced the use of unnecessary data making it more effective
Drawbacks
Even though it is better than offline models, running ML on small WSN devices still consumes memory and energy
This model still struggled with some types of attacks
Idea
In this research paper this only focused one some types of attacks and it neglected various kinds of attack.
In this one i think of making it adaptive to all kinds of attack wihout neglecting some attacks.

4) Online payment fraud: from anomaly detection to risk management.
This paper has 81 citations.
Models used
Anomaly detection
Triage model
Risk model
Achievements
Adaptability to Fraud Behavior
Improved Detection Performance
Machine learning model alone reduced losses by 15% compared to rule-based systems.
Drawbacks
This couldnot explain why it was flagged unsafe
This didnot learn continuously with the new attacks
Dataset
data set not exactly mentioned for this one
Idea
I have one idea of making it show what the fault was in this , like showing what threat it was showing and why it was flagged unsafe

5) Healthcare and anomaly detection using machine learning to predict anomalies in heart rate data.
Main motive is to use machine learning to adapt them into heart rate sensors, so it can give out vital informations about patients and would help in treatment.
Models used
Random Forests (RF)
Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest (IF)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Achievements
This really helped doctor to get accurate information on patients vitals
Using random forest really helpd to give out 100% acccuray
Drawbacks
False alarms, caused due to external noise or surroundings, this most of the time confused the health care workers.
Only focuses on heart rate, neglecting othe vitals
Not for long term
Project ideas
Trying to make a sensor that can be used for checking all vitals, trying to fix the issue of false alarm
Datasets
Simulated Heart Rate Data
MIT-BIH Heart Rate Database
